Then, download and install the game again from your Steam account.
- Download and install the fmodex.dll file manually. If neither of the above methods works, you can try to download and install the fmodex.dll file manually from a reliable source. However, this is not recommended as it can pose security risks and cause compatibility issues. If you decide to do this, make sure you scan the file with an antivirus program before installing it. Also, make sure you place it in the correct folder. For Hitman Sniper Challenge, the fmodex.dll file should be in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hitman Sniper Challenge\bin folder.
